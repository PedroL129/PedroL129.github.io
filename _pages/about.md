I am a passionate of software since I was young. My passion starts around 2005, when my uncle gave me an old computer for their company. It runs Windows98 and only have the minimal programs but I learn typing and tinker.

After school and a two-years course of software development, in the 2014 I started working but I have never stopped leaning. During this time I have worked in different sectors like industry, public administration, retail... But now, it is time to discover the telecommunications industry.

These are the companies where I worked.
